# Southern Italy

I did not expect that. Italy is my zone. I go to Italy once or twice a year. I lived in Florence for four months. I speak Italian (not as well as I used to, yet more than enough to get by).
As a result, Italy is one of the countries where I'm most comfortable. I understand how things work. I know what to eat, what to wear, what to do at different times of day. I'm well versed in the passeggiatta and penalties of not validating your train ticket.

Sicily was my tenth region to visit in Italy (after Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Liguria, Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Puglia). I would immediately designate it the region that has the least in common with other regions. 

Sicily had a wildness in the way the overgrown plants spilled onto the highway, in the way gargoyle-like rocks rose out of the sea, in the way children rode their bikes around piazzas at 1:00 AM.
But most significantly, I had a lot of communication issues. English was only spoken in the most touristy areas, and in the more rural areas, the locals spoke Sicilian dialect.

As a result, even when I spoke Italian, we could barely understand each other. I would understand maybe one word, tops, out of the whole sentence.
I'll admit that this was overwhelming and embarrassing for me on many occasions. Traveling seamlessly in Italy is a mark of pride for me, and I hated feeling so helpless.
