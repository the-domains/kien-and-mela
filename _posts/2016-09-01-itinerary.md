## Itinerary

Today we hopped on the the **Sita** bus towards **Amalfi** as we continue on down the coast. This is indeed a scenic bus ride, especially if you sit on the right side of the bus. Going up and down the winding road just wide enough to fit 2 normal cars, you can imagine the absolute precisions needed for the bus driver to maneuver a full length bus. We ended up standing for the first 20-30 minutes of the ride before half of the occupants (adventurous bunch of oldies) hopped off for a 10km hike back down to Sorrento. About 1:30hrs in, we arrived in Amalfi town.

We won't be staying in Amalfi town itself, but rather, **Atrani**, which is just 400m from the bus terminal. Atrani is the tiniest town in Italy, tucked nicely between towering rock faces and fronted by a small beach. A quaint little town that is away from the tourist town of Amalfi town and therefore cheaper as well. We are staying at [EvaRooms][0] hosted by Pio. He manages 3 rooms in the apartment and another is reserved for his mum. Lovely guy who also told us that the place got famous after someone from The Guardian newspaper stayed for 2-3 nights without him knowing and wrote a review about it. Now, its packed regardless of the season.

Pio recommended us to have lunch at the foot of the town next to the main entrance to town called **Le Palme**. We decided to go for the set menu where i had the _Amalfi Menu_ and Mela had the _Atrani Menu_, a bit on the pricier side at 30€ each but absolutely stuffed after lunch.

While waiting for the bus to head to Ravello which is just a short bus ride away, where a few buses went by which were not going there and we started to get impatient. An auntie was also waiting there started talking to us in Italian, asking us where we are going etc etc. With a bit magic gestures and interpretations on both sides, she understood the situation and told us (we thought) that she is going on a bus that will stop near Ravello and we can walk the remaining part of it. So why not. Fair enough, she spoke to the driver and we got there just like she described it. Funnily, after few hours in Ravello and going back to Atrani, we saw each other again stopping in the same bus stop from a different bus. Impeccable timing.

Ravello is a popular small town 365m above the sea, famed for 1-2 of its villas with beautiful gardens and views. During the Ravello Festival, there are concerts situated in the villas overlooking the vast sea.

![Villa Rufolo with a nice garden facing the sea](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4d8d8ab6-7132-4c57-b6c0-b31117f63572.jpg)

Then on the way (uphill) to **Villa Cimbrone**, we took a break in one of the quiet cafes. Some homemade red orange + lemon juice and a cappuccino (+ cookies).

**Villa Cimbrone**, to me is one of the highlights of this whole trip. A villa with a long history and multiple changes in ownership, it is now part hotel (on one side) and part open garden (pay to enter) that is well taken care of. A very serene environment, lots of paths to walk on, sculptures to see and incredible garden to enjoy, it was well worth the trip.

It was a rather long day, so instead of coming out for dinner later on, we decided to go into the little Atrani town and buy: cold cuts, cheese and a box of white wine (2€!).
