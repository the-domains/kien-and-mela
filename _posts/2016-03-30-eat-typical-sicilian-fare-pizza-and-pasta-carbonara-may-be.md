There will be more detailed follow-up posts and photos of course, but suffice to say that it's been blowing my expectations out of the ballpark. Landscape, people and food-wise it was nothing short of a wonderful and enriching experience and if it wasn't for Fabrizia Lanza, we wouldn't have had the opportunity to begin with. Since we know of a few friends (hey, we're looking at you Kerrin, Natalie and Kasey) that are planning on visiting the island shortly, we thought about compiling a few tidbits about Sicily.

## The Food

Eat typical Sicilian fare. Pizza and Pasta Carbonara may be Italian, but you came to Sicily for a reason, so don't miss out!

Taste oranges and smell citrus fruits whenever you can, they are ridiculously good and there is an abundance of it, both in amounts and variety. Same goes for almonds, pistachios and olives.

Try fresh ricotta (sheep's milk), in fact have plenty of it and then have a bit more. Also, don't forget the other side of the family, fried ricotta, Cannoli, Tricotta and the obligatory piece of Cassata.

There is a reason why Sicily is big on sardines and swordfish, whether it's part of a pasta dish or on their own. Of course, fresh seafood in general is a can't-go-wrong-option. But so are the fried food indulgences like Arancine (balls of saffron rice filled with meat, cheese etc.) or Panelle (delicious deep fried fritters made with chickpea flour; one of my favorites) and vegetable dishes including Maccu di Favi (soup made with dried fava beans, wild fennel and chili pepper), countless artichoke variations and the manifold sweet and sour Caponata.

A general observation on restaurants, especially in low season they may or may not be open when you choose to pay them a visit. Website information may be incorrect or non-existent and don't expect to find opening times on the restaurant's door either. Always have a backup plan (or be willing to look for another spot...). On a tech note, still too many restaurant websites only use Flash, solely relying on your iPhone to figure things out may prove to be difficult.

## Getting Around

Flying into Sicily leaves you with two main options, Catania or Palermo. Depending on your timeline you may want to focus on either the NW'ern or S/SE'ern side of Sicily. Up to you. Our recommendation, start with the East and South: Catania/Etna region, cross country to Case Vecchie/Regaleali or Agrigento (or, down to Ragusa, Modica, Scicli, Noto, Siracusa/Ortigia and back to Catania. Lots, LOTS to see on that route.
